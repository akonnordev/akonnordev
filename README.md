Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Akonnor Owusu Larbi, a web developer from Accra, Ghana. I love programming both as a job and as a hobby and I spend a lot of time writing code and testing out new ideas. I work mainly with web technologies such as JavaScript, CSS and HTML. My target is to learn Node.js, React, SCSS and UI/UX. Adding Ruby on Rails knowledge is a plus for me.

I design and develop web apps using the latest technologies to deliver high-quality products.
