### Hello!  ðŸ‘‹

## My Akonnor Owusu Larbi
I am a certified AWS Cloud Practitioner with a passion for web development. Since 2018, I have been creating websites using WordPress, catering to a wide range of clients from the USA, UK, Ireland, Canada, Singapore, Kenya, and Ghana. My expertise spans all types of websites, including e-commerce platforms and church websites with donations.

I specialize in converting ideas into fully functional web applications, helping businesses and organizations establish a strong online presence. My services also include developing professional business emails with advanced spam detection and security measures to block malicious IPs and contacts.

I am currently expanding my skill set by learning React.js, Node.js, Express.js, and PostgreSQL to provide even more robust and dynamic web solutions.

With over 40 websites developed across various sectors, I have the experience and knowledge to bring your web projects to life. Some of my notable projects include:
